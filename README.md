# CslaExtremeDemos

Extreme demos for Rockford Lhotka's CSLA .NET framework.

This demo focus on some important questions, that are lacking proper documentation/demos/samples:

1) use of SmartDataReader with properties that are nullable on the database

2) use of ComboBox with NameValueList (and persist as null)

3) use of ComboBox with enum

    - use of the Description attribute
    - persist the enum value (instead of the named constant)
    - persist enum value 0 as null
    - use enum values of type byte

4) simple WindowsForms databinding using BindingSource
